\chapter{The game console}
\label{cha:GameConsole}

\section{Overview}
	\par The console has some specific features that will be described here. All of the aspects of hardware requirements, memory usage, input and output\ldots will be explained.
	Based on the image below, all requirements and specifications will be defined, from the controller to the interpreter to the graphics control.
	Any of these blocks is a stand-alone configuration, but the interpreter and the graphics control compose the actual console.

\section{Controller}
	\subsection{Overview}
		\par A total of 8 push buttons are present on the controller, each with a pressed and a released state. When the user presses a button the state changes form released to pressed and vice versa. The controller uses an SPI interface to allow communication with the game.
		Multiplayer is possible when connecting 2 controllers at once.

		\end{figure}

	\subsection{Buttons}
		\subsubsection{D-Pad}
			\par Four of the buttons at the left side of the controller are formed as a D-Pad, a flat thumb-operated four-way directional control with one push button on each point,
			providing intuitive direction and steering capabilities, and should be used as such.

		\subsubsection{Select and start}
			\par In the center, the select and start button are located.
			These should be used to start the game, pause it, allow menu navigation etc.
			The start button should allow pausing the game at any point, pressing start again returns to the game.

		\subsubsection{A and B}
			\par Next to the select and start buttons, A and B are located.
			These two buttons are to be used in-game, providing interaction with objects on the screen.
			They should not be used to pause or unpause the game at any time.

	\subsection{Interface}
		\par The controller connects through a three-wire interface similar to SPI. A maximum of two controllers can be connected, addressed as 0 and 1. The timing can be seen in this view (clockperiod of 6$\mu$s, from top to bottom: Latch, Clock, Data):

\section{Interpreter}
	\subsection{Overview}
		\par The interpreter is the main unit of the console. It executes the code and sends commands to the graphics controller to ensure the data displayed on screen is correct.
		Since the code is stored in external cartridge memory in the form of bytecode, specific requirement should be met to obtain accurate behaviour:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item MCU: PIC18F4620 (8-bit, 8 MHz)
			\item RAM: 3968 bytes - 256 bytes can be used by one game
			\item Input: NES controller (max 2)
		\end{itemize}

			\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{GameConsole/Interpreter_overview.PNG}
			\label{fig:InterpreterOverview}
		\end{figure}

	\subsection{Peripherals}
		\subsubsection{Registers}
			\par Data transfer and manipulation is done via registers.
			These are memory locations that can be used to perform arithmetics on, used as delay counter\ldots
			They can be used as data storage, but the RAM is a better place for this.
			In total, 16 8-bit wide registers can be used, yet one should be used with caution since it will be overwritten by some specific instructions.
			Registers 0 to 14 are free to use, and will only be overwritten when the code tells the interpreter to do so.
			The 15th register, called the HL register, is used by the interpreter as data buffer for e.g. reading a controller or timer.

		\subsubsection{Stack}
			\par The stack is used to temporarly store data when the interpreter executes a subroutine or a register should be stored for later use.
			It is a LIFO structure of 256 items long, each item being 8 bit wide.
			The stack pointer is 8 bit too, but cannot be manipulated by the user directly: push and pop instructions are supported, and are available through the interpreter.

		\subsubsection{Program counter}
			\par The program counter is a pointer to where the interpreter is in the code.
			It is a 16 bit unsigned short, starting at 0 for the first instruction.
			Each instruction or operand increments this program counter.
			The program counter cannot be manipulated by the user directly, but should go through the jump, call or return instructions of the interpreter.
			A jump instruction replaces the program counter by a new value, while the call instruction pushes the current program counter to the stack and then replaces the program counter by the new one.
			Return pops the program counter from the stack at the end of a subroutine, and replaces the current program counter by this value, which results in a return to the point of calling the subroutine.

		\subsubsection{RAM}
			\par RAM can be used to store data during the execution of a program, it is 256 items long, each item being 8 bits wide.
			It will never be overwritten by the interpreter automatically, yet overwriting can happen when the code tells the interpreter to do so.
			It is possible to exchange data from a register to a RAM address and the other way around.
			Data that should be stored over a longer period of time can be placed in RAM, and copied back to a register for later manipulation.

	\subsection{Cartridge memory mapping}
		\par An important aspect of every game is the memory mapping on the cartridge.
		Every item (code, sprites, strings and maps) has its own specific start- and endaddress to establish a solid and correct performance. The mapping is as follows:

		\begin{figure}[H]
			\centering
			\includegraphics[width=0.65\textwidth]{GameConsole/MemoryMap.PNG}
			\caption{Memory map of the cartridge}\par
			\label{fig:MemoryMap}
		\end{figure}

		\subsubsection{Code}
			\par This is the actual bytecode that will be interpreted and executed. An in-depth look on the instructionset can be found in chapter~\ref{cha:InstructionSet}. The maximum codesize is 64kB, or 65536 bytes. If no jump is performed at byte 65535, the program counter will overflow, resulting in a reset of the program counter to zero. Code examples can be found in the appendix.

		\subsubsection{Sprites}
		\label{subsec:sprites}
			\par A sprite is an 8 by 8 pixels bitmap in black and white. Each bit represents one pixel, resulting in a size of 8 bytes per sprite.
			The addressing starts at the top left, and goes down per colum, this happens to be 8 bits, and can thus be packed in one byte.
			The first colum is the first byte, the second colum the second byte\ldots

				\begin{tabular}{m{0.2em} m{0.2em} m{0.2em} m{0.2em} m{0.2em} m{0.2em} m{0.2em} m{0.2em} cccccccccc}
					$\square$      & $\square$      & $\blacksquare$ & $\blacksquare$ & $\blacksquare$ & $\blacksquare$ & $\square$      & $\square$      &&& 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
					$\square$      & $\blacksquare$ & $\square$      & $\square$      & $\blacksquare$ & $\blacksquare$ & $\blacksquare$ & $\square$      &&& 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\
					$\blacksquare$ & $\square$      & $\square$      & $\blacksquare$ & $\blacksquare$ & $\blacksquare$ & $\blacksquare$ & $\blacksquare$ &&& 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
					$\blacksquare$ & $\square$      & $\blacksquare$ & $\blacksquare$ & $\blacksquare$ & $\blacksquare$ & $\blacksquare$ & $\blacksquare$ &&& 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
					$\blacksquare$ & $\blacksquare$ & $\blacksquare$ & $\blacksquare$ & $\blacksquare$ & $\blacksquare$ & $\blacksquare$ & $\blacksquare$ &&& 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
					$\blacksquare$ & $\blacksquare$ & $\blacksquare$ & $\blacksquare$ & $\blacksquare$ & $\blacksquare$ & $\blacksquare$ & $\blacksquare$ &&& 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
					$\square$      & $\blacksquare$ & $\blacksquare$ & $\blacksquare$ & $\blacksquare$ & $\blacksquare$ & $\blacksquare$ & $\square$      &&& 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\
					$\square$      & $\square$      & $\blacksquare$ & $\blacksquare$ & $\blacksquare$ & $\blacksquare$ & $\square$      & $\square$      &&& 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
				\end{tabular}
			\end{table}
			
			This sprite, representing a ball, has the binary representation in the right table.
			Since we address by colum, the first byte is 0b00111100, which corresponds to 0x3C.
			The second colum is 0b01001110, and thus 0x4E.
			When all pixels are calculated the bytes are placed after one another, resulting in a complete sprite, here 0x3C4E9FBFFFFF7E3C.

		\subsubsection{Maps}
			\par A map is a combination of sprites that can fill the background of the screen.
			Placing a map on the screen can be functional, e.g. in a platformer game, or aesthetically.
			It is in fact a tiled field containing the indexes of sprites in the onscreen memory, each tile being 8 by 8 pixels (equal to 1 sprite).
			For more information on maps, please refer to the chapter~\ref{subsec:maps}.

		\subsubsection{Strings}
			\par Strings can be used to be drawn on screen as guidelines or instructions to the user.
			They are to be stored in the cartrigde memory as null-terminated ascii encoded strings, and will be read as such.
			If a string is not null-terminated, the interpreter will read until the first null is encountered, which can result in unexpected behaviour.
			A maximun total size of 10kB of strings can be loaded into the ROM, yet that amount can never be displayed at once on the screen, since the string buffer is limited to 256 bytes.
			For more information on strings, refer to the chapters~\ref{subsec:stringdata} and ~\ref{subsec:strings}.

		\subsubsection{Savebanks}
			\par The savebanks are 10 address locations of each 1kB that can be used freely by the game.
			If playernames, highscores, achievements\ldots should be stored, this is the location to do so.
			The game will not check if the data is legitimate or not, this is up to the programmer.
			Settings should not be stored in savebanks, for this has its own address location.

		\subsubsection{Splash screen}
			\par A splash screen is the screen that should be shown while all data is loaded and transfered between the interpreter and the graphics control.
			It has to be a black and white bitmap addressed from the top left down each colum.
			Since the screen is 84x48, a fullscreen bitmap is 4032 bits, or 504 bytes.

		\subsubsection{Settings}
			\par Settings can be stored in this address location.
			No restrictions are applied, and the content is up to the programmer.
