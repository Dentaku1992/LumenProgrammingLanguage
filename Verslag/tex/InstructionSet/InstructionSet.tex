\chapter{Instruction Set}
\label{cha:InstructionSet}

Each LUMEN instruction is a 8-bit byte divided into an OPCODE which specifies the instruction
type and one or more operands which further specify the operation of the instruction. These operands
are also 8-bit. The LUMEN instruction summary in described in this chapter lists the instructions recognized by the 
LUMEN compiler. The instructions set can be grouped in 7 basic categories:

	\begin{itemize}
		  \item Variable manipulation
		  \item Mathematical operations
		  \item Logic manipulation
		  \item Calls and Jumps
		  \item Stack manipulation
		  \item Graphics
		  \item Sounds
	\end{itemize}

\noindent All instructions are executed in one single instruction cycle, unless a conditional test is true
or the program counter is changed as a result of an instruction. In these cases the execution takes two instruction
cycles with the second cycle as an NOP. One instruction cycle consist out of XXX clock cycles.
